Thoughts on JS api for visualization

- graph.refocusOnUser( user, hops, maxNodes ) <-- focus on a node, 
    - get info for that user 
    - download a node set of all within N hops, up to M maximum nodes
    - enter the nodes that we want
    - once that's done, exit the nodes we don't want

- graph.addUser( user )
   - enters a user into the graph

- graph.removeUser( user )
   - exits the user

- user.removeProxy(user)
    - what you expect… 

- user.addProxy(user, user)
    - remove a proxy if it exists
    - add the proxy

The 'no expressed preference' option is the same for all votes: option 0
Other options get their own unique immutable IDs
- user.vote( option )

(May have an option to hide the "no expressed preference"…?)

behind the scenes.... data model

array of users, current weights, any other info
array of proxies
  -> modify the children handler to use this rather than looking for children property
